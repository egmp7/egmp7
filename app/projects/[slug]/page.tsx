This application fosters collaboration by allowing students to share their feedback and insights with their peers, helping others make informed decisions when selecting modules. Built as a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, it leverages the Slack SDK to seamlessly receive and manage data from students directly within the Slack Workspace.",

    challengesAndSolutions: "One challenge I encountered was ordering the reviews, as the data lacked proper indexing. Currently, the application loads all the reviews from the database and then reorders them on the client side. While this approach works for now, I recognize that as the user base grows, this method will become inefficient and will need to be optimized with better indexing or server-side sorting. As the team leader, another challenge was maintaining clear communication and coordination with the team. To address this, we used Linear to create tickets, which helped us stay organized and ensure all requirements were clearly defined and tracked throughout the development process..",
